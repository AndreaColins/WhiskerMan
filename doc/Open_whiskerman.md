# Whi[s]kerMan Documentation

### Open WhiskerMan 

1. Extract Whiskerman  to a folder (e.g. "C:\user\whiskerman ").

2. Within Matlab, add this folder to the current path (e.g addpath(‘C:\ user\whiskerman’)).

3. Make a  folder that contains the horizontal view videos (e.g. cd ‘C:\ExampleH’). If doing 3D tracking also, within this folder, create a sub-folder called “vertical_view” (the name must be exactly this) containing the vertical view videos.

4. Within Matlab, “cd” to the folder containing the horizontal view videos and enter ‘WhiskerMan’ on the command line.  A GUI resembling the following should appear.
